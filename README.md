-- IDS with the type of attack
-- we can think og rule enforcement for prevention. (once done with IDS) ie mitigation


1. simulation with mininet and ryu (attack generation)
2. feature extraction from simulation with wireshark
3. ML model prerocessing, hyper parameter tuning, accuracy determination 
4. what kind of attacks do we have to focus on?
5. include ml model in a module that seamlessly fits with the ryu controller.
6. representation of this output.
